[HOME/LANDING PAGE]

Thank you for visiting the Wells Fargo Sibos webpage.

Singapore — host site of Sibos 2015 — successfully progressed during the 20th century from a tiny island state to one of the richest and most cosmopolitan places in the world.
With little land and no natural resources, the country has evolved into a financial, transportation, and manufacturing hub.

In a world of increasing competition and ever-changing regulations, financial institutions must make similar transitions.
Wells Fargo can help you throughout the journey.
Like a backbone that supports your company, you can rely on Wells Fargo’s expertise and global resources to help you navigate the constantly evolving financial services sector.
Our custom financial products and services, experienced local relationship managers, and 160-plus years of strength and stability can help you gain momentum to move your business forward.

Come visit our booth (stand No.
D26) and learn more about Wells Fargo’s evolution and the achievements we have made to help our customers and partners succeed around the world.

[SECTION V: EXPLORE SINGAPORE]
Singapore is hardly short on things to see and do — with entertainment for all ages, grand architecture, multicultural meals, luscious green spaces, and endless shopping on Orchard road.
To celebrate its 50th year of independence in 2015, Singapore has elevated its attractions.
It’s no wonder that Lonely Planet named it the #1 top country to visit in its “Best in Travel 2015.”

While in Singapore, you may want to:
•	Walk the waterfront.
Singapore may be a small, but there are several architectural landmarks around Marina Bay that create the city’s signature skyline.
Stroll along the 11.7-kilometer route around the Marina Reservoir and you’ll see highlights like Singapore’s Helix bridge, Sun Yat Seng Nanyang Memorial Hall, One Raffles Place, and Youth Olympic Park http://www.marina-bay.sg/promenade.html
•	Explore stunning green spaces.
Singapore is known as the “greenest city on earth,” with nearly 10% of its land set aside for parks and nature reserves.
Gardens by the Bay spans 101 hectares of reclaimed land, offers stunning waterfront views, and features a choreographed Garden Rhapsody light and sound show amidst 18 massive solar-powered SuperTrees.
http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/home.html
•	Feast on the local cuisine.
Singapore is a magnet for star chefs, but if sophisticated dining isn’t for you, you can find a delectable feast of local cuisine — Hainanese chicken rice, porridge, tapioca pastries, meat fritters, and curries — in the city’s more than 100 hawker centers.
Maxwell Road Food Centre in Chinatown is one of the oldest.
http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/dining/restaurants/maxwell-road-hawker-centre.html
•	Indulge in art.
Art in all forms is located across the city, in the Singapore Art Museum, Ritz-Carlton, and more.
But if you’re looking to make a single stop, choose either Gillman Barracks, which houses 17 international galleries showcasing contemporary art , or visit Marina Bay’s lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum, home to 21 galleries featuring art, science, and international touring exhibitions — including the largest collection of abyssal creatures and an exhibition showcasing two decades of Dreamworks animation.
http://gillmanbarracks.com/ and http://www.marinabaysands.com/museum.html
•	Shop till you drop.
You can spend days browsing the retail shops and food courts located in malls all along Orchard Road.
But a hip strip of boutique retail shops also can be found on Haji Lane in Singapore’s Muslim quarter, Kampong Glam.
http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/see-and-do/hip-hangouts/haji-lane.html
•	Take an after-dark adventure.
Wildlife Reserves Singapore is the country’s #1 nightspot.
During the Night Safari, you’ll see thousands of animals from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas in their natural environments — while helping to fund conservation, rescue, and research to improve the lives of animals in captivity and in the wild.

[SECTION VI: CHARITABLE GIVING]

Together, we can make a difference
“At Wells Fargo, we believe our responsibility as a corporation goes beyond protecting our customers’ assets and helping them succeed financially.
We want to help create long-term economic growth and quality of life in our communities.
As our business and communities have expanded globally, so has our role to lead by example and make a difference through our ongoing corporate social responsibility efforts.” — John Stumpf, President and CEO

In 2014, Wells Fargo reached important milestones for our corporate social responsibility efforts:
•	The Chronicle of Philanthropy named us the No.
1 corporate donor in the U.S.
in its annual survey of corporate giving
•	For the fifth year in a row, we were named United Way Worldwide’s # 1 workplace giving campaign in the U.S for the record US$64.9 million our team members contributed to nonprofits and schools
•	Wells Fargo team members volunteered a record 1.7 million hours in their communities

With your help, we can continue to invest in the communities where our team members live and work.
We invite you, for the fifth year in a row, to cast a vote for one of four nonprofits that our team members volunteered with in our local communities.
Based on this poll, which we will host at our Wells Fargo Sibos reception, we will determine how to distribute a total of $10,000 U.S.
dollars to these four charities.
