                                        motivation for creative thinking and excellence in their lives through art.
                                        It is the most rewarding volunteer experience I have ever experienced,
                                        because I get to apply my visual arts teaching background by working as a teacher&rsquo;s
                                        assistant in workshops in the underserved communities of Toronto.
                                        In turn, the children develop their life and leadership skills by teaching their classmates what they learn
                                        and contributing to safe and vibrant schools and communities.
                                        We call the kids who are chosen to come to DAREarts out of their classrooms &lsquo;delegates&rsquo;
                                        because we &lsquo;dare&rsquo; them to then go back to their respective schools as leaders.&rdquo;</em>

                                <p><em>Cradles to Crayons </em>provides children from birth through age 12, living in homeless or low-income situations,
                                    with the essential items they need to thrive—at home, at school and at play.
                                    Cradles to Crayons collects new and nearly new children's items through community drives and corporate donations
                                    and distributes them to disadvantaged children across the state through a collaborative network of social service agencies and school partners. </p>

                                    <em>&ldquo;Cradles to Crayons (C2C) has become an essential part of my volunteering,
                                        and I&rsquo;m grateful to be able to share that sense of community with both my colleagues and my family.
                                        I believe it is impossible to walk away from C2C without feeling fulfilled, humbled,
                                        and optimistic about the impact every single one of us can make!  It is for that reason that I try to go as often as I can
                                        – and the reason why my children constantly ask when it&rsquo;s time to go pack backpacks for the kids at C2C.&rdquo;</em>

                                        I love what Cradles to Crayons does and their understanding and effort to improve the self-worth of these underprivileged kids.
                                        Giving these underprivileged kids clothes is one step in improving their lives and self-image.&rdquo;</em>
