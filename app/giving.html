                                It’s been that way since our founding in 1852 when cofounder Henry Wells said,
                                ‘Our lives are not measured by the number of years and days we exist,
                                but by what we accomplish while we live, and the good we may render to our fellow man.’
                                That heritage holds true today — and it’s important to our future.”

                                    Habitat’s work in Brazil has helped 12,708 families in 11 states throughout the country by helping to build 4,531 homes and improve 1,512 homes.
                                    It also has helped 2,356 families secure land tenure.

                                        Brazil represents such a dichotomy of socioeconomic conditions while still being rooted in a deep sense of culture.
