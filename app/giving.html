                                It’s been that way since our founding in 1852 when cofounder Henry Wells said,
                                ‘Our lives are not measured by the number of years and days we exist,
                                but by what we accomplish while we live, and the good we may render to our fellow man.’
                                That heritage holds true today — and it’s important to our future.”

                                    Habitat’s work in Brazil has helped 12,708 families in 11 states throughout the country by helping to build 4,531 homes and improve 1,512 homes.
                                    It also has helped 2,356 families secure land tenure.

                                        motivation for creative thinking and excellence in their lives through art.

                                        because I get to apply my visual arts teaching background by working as a teacher&rsquo;s
                                        assistant in workshops in the underserved communities of Toronto.
                                        In turn, the children develop their life and leadership skills by teaching their classmates what they learn
                                        and contributing to safe and vibrant schools and communities.
                                        We call the kids who are chosen to come to DAREarts out of their classrooms &lsquo;delegates&rsquo;
