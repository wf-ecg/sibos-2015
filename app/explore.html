                                Singapore has an ample supply of things to see and do — with entertainment for all ages, grand architecture, multicultural meals, luscious green spaces, and endless shopping opportunities on Orchard Road.
                                2015 marks Singapore’s 50th year of independence and as a result, it has elevated its attractions.
                                It’s no wonder that Lonely Planet named it the #1 top country to visit in its “Best in Travel 2015.”

                                    Explore the various architectural landmarks around Marina Bay that create the city’s signature skyline.
                                    Stroll along the 11.7-kilometer route around the Marina Reservoir and you’ll see highlights like Singapore’s Helix bridge,
                                    Sun Yat Seng Nanyang Memorial Hall, One Raffles Place, and Youth Olympic Park.

                                    Singapore is known as the “greenest city on earth,” with nearly 10% of its land set aside for parks and nature reserves.
                                    Gardens by the Bay spans 101 hectares of reclaimed land, offering stunning waterfront views,
                                    and featuring a choreographed Garden Rhapsody light and sound show amidst 18 massive solar-powered Supertrees.

                                    While Singapore is home to numerous celebrity chefs; the local cuisine is as rich and varied as its people.
                                    Be sure to sample a few of the famous local dishes — Hainanese chicken rice, porridge, tapioca pastries, meat fritters, and curries — in the city’s 100-plus hawker centers.
                                    Maxwell Road Food Centre in Chinatown is one of the oldest.

                                    Art in all forms can be found across the city, in the Singapore Art Museum, Ritz-Carlton, and more.
                                    But if you’re looking to make a single stop, choose either Gillman Barracks, which houses 17 international galleries showcasing contemporary art,
                                    or visit Marina Bay’s lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum, which is home to 21 galleries featuring art, science, and international touring exhibitions —
                                    including the largest collection of abyssal creatures and an exhibition showcasing the evolution of Singapore through stories of its origin, adversity, failure, and triumph.

                                    You can spend days browsing the retail shops and food courts located in malls all along Orchard Road.
                                    But a hip strip of boutique retail shops also can be found on Haji Lane in Singapore’s Muslim quarter, Kampong Glam.

                                    During the Night Safari, you’ll see thousands of animals from Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas in their natural environments —
                                    while helping to fund conservation, rescue, and research to improve the lives of animals in captivity and in the wild.
